## Description
The Random Colour Generator Web App is a simple and fun application designed to generate multiple random colours and codes with JavaScript. Built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Upon refreshing the page, the colors and codes change randomly for up to 30 color containers. The web app is also designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes. It displays the colors in four columns on larger screens, then decreases to three, two and ultimately one column for smaller screens. This provides a seamless user experience on any device.
