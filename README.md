## ðŸ“Œ Description
The Random Colour Generator is a simple, fun, and interactive web app that generates random colors and their corresponding hex codes. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Upon refreshing the page, up to 30 color containers are displayed with randomly generated colors and their hex codes. The app also features a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes. On larger screens, it shows the colors in four columns, and as the screen size decreases, it adjusts to three, two, or even one column for smaller devices. This ensures a smooth and enjoyable user experience across all devices.
